# Using Jupyter

VTK can be used from within [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) by utilizing its
python package. When it comes to rendering it can be combined with the
[itkwidgets](https://itkwidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest) package.

For more details, check [this](https://colab.research.google.com/github/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets/blob/main/examples/integrations/vtk/vtkImageData.ipynb) example.
